# DotaUpcomingEventsTicker

## About

This is a Windows 7, 8, 8.1 program (exe) that goes and scapes the "Live" and "Upcoming" matches found on "http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/gosubet".

The program is written in C# with the UI being made in WPF.

For the UI part, i am using components from [Material Skin](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin) - that is a WPF component library for implementing Google "material design".

## Features

* The live matches will show up in the list and clicking the "WATCH" will open your current default browser and navigate to the stream URL on gosugamers.
* Clicking on a "bell" icon will set up a notification for that match. You can minimize the program and let it run in the background. Triggering at least 1 notification will make the list refresh once every minute. When the match is live, you will see a popup window.
